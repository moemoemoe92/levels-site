# AI Development Instructions

This document provides essential context for AI coding agents working on the Levels Café landing page project.

## Project Overview

This is the official landing page for Levels Café, a new project currently in its initial setup phase. The site aims to provide an engaging web presence for the café.

## Repository Structure

Currently minimal, with plans to expand:

```
levels-site/
├── .github/            # GitHub configurations and AI instructions
└── README.md          # Project introduction
```

## Development Conventions

As this project is in its early stages, we'll establish and document conventions here as they emerge. Key areas to be defined include:

- Frontend framework and styling approach
- Build and deployment processes
- Testing strategy
- Code organization patterns

## Future Development Notes

Areas planned for implementation:

1. Landing page design and components
2. Menu presentation
3. Location and contact information
4. Social media integration
5. Performance optimization for images and assets

## Contributing

Follow these steps when making changes:
1. Create descriptive branch names (`feature/add-menu-section`, `fix/header-alignment`)
2. Submit PRs with clear descriptions of changes
3. Ensure responsive design works across device sizes
4. Optimize images and assets before committing

Note: This is a starter template - we'll expand these instructions as the project grows and establishes more concrete patterns and conventions.
